    It's time for a serious
          gut check.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.736 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
  How can a little capsule do
so much?  Regenerative, organic

 everything you need to know.

00:00:34.613 --> 00:00:36.248 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
  When you dig into a field.

00:00:36.248 --> 00:00:38.517 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
      You want your soil
     to be like a sponge,

00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:40.285 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
  plus a game of probiotics.

00:00:40.285 --> 00:00:41.620 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
        True or false?

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.990 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
          Probiotics
   only benefit gut health.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.492 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
     That's not the case.
         Not the case.

00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:01.140 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
           I'm Sonya Azad
         health and wellness

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.975 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
     expert here at Merit Street
               Media.

00:01:02.975 --> 00:01:04.710 line:68.66% position:10.00% align:start 
 My guest today is Jordan Rubin,

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.178 line:58.00% position:10.00% align:start 
      New York Times
        bestselling

00:01:06.178 --> 00:01:09.381 line:58.00% position:10.00% align:start 
author and founder of Ancient
        Nutrition.

00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:10.983 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
  Also, and most importantly,

00:01:10.983 --> 00:01:14.953 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
       one of America's
leading farmers of superfoods.

00:01:14.953 --> 00:01:16.588 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
     Good to see you. It's
       great to be back.

00:01:16.588 --> 00:01:18.924 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
         What a treat
     to have a farmer here

00:01:18.924 --> 00:01:21.160 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
        to talk with us
  about regenerative health.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.928 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
 But our most important topic

00:01:22.928 --> 00:01:25.531 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
    that we want to tackle
  today is about probiotics.

00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:28.901 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
This is something that's super
     confusing to people.

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:30.769 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
     What are probiotics?

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:32.504 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
     Why do we need them?

00:01:32.504 --> 00:01:34.106 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
   When should we use them?

00:01:34.106 --> 00:01:37.342 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
          Probiotics
    simply are good germs.

00:01:37.342 --> 00:01:39.144 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
  Now, if you would have told
        my grandmother

00:01:39.144 --> 00:01:41.547 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
or great grandmother growing up
     that germs are good,

00:01:41.547 --> 00:01:43.782 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
 they would have looked at you
           sideways.

00:01:43.782 --> 00:01:47.486 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
    But our digestive tract
        is battleground

00:01:47.486 --> 00:01:50.022 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
          number one
    for all things health.

00:01:50.022 --> 00:01:53.759 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
   You need more good germs,
        more probiotics

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.662 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
  than negative or bad germs.

00:01:56.662 --> 00:01:59.998 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
And when that balance is there,
     you are very healthy.

00:01:59.998 --> 00:02:03.135 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
 But what's interesting about
          gut health?

00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:06.872 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
  It isn't simply focused on
        gas, bloating,

00:02:06.872 --> 00:02:08.507 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
         indigestion,
the things we don't talk about

00:02:08.507 --> 00:02:11.143 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
      at the dinner table
 that everybody goes through.

00:02:11.143 --> 00:02:14.446 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
 Now, researchers believe that
    the health of your gut

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:17.649 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
  affects your immune system,
     your nervous system,

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:22.721 line:79.33% position:10.00% align:start 
     including your brain
 and every aspect of wellness.

00:02:22.721 --> 00:02:24.623 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
   In fact, leading doctors
         believe that

00:02:24.623 --> 00:02:27.826 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
 no matter what you have going
     on, the way to get to

00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:28.927 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
       the bottom of it

00:02:28.927 --> 00:02:32.464 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
      is through your gut
 and the guardians of your gut

00:02:32.831 --> 00:02:33.699 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
        are probiotics.

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:34.866 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
       Oh, I like that.

00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:36.735 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
   The guardians of your gut
 and I have so many questions

00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:40.138 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
       about probiotics
   prebiotics post biotics,

00:02:40.138 --> 00:02:41.940 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
   but I do want to explain,

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.508 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
       for those of you
 who might be new to the show,

00:02:43.508 --> 00:02:46.645 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
  what is regenerative health
 and sort of connect the dots

00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:50.115 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
    for us between farming
 and what we're talking about.

00:02:50.115 --> 00:02:53.785 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
      Regenerative health
   simply means taking back

00:02:53.785 --> 00:02:57.689 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
        what was lost,
   bringing life from death.

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.459 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
     And that happens each
  and every day in our body.

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.495 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
Cells die. New cells are reborn.

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:06.999 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
   We've got microorganisms
           that live

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:08.934 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
  one day they die the next.

00:03:08.934 --> 00:03:13.272 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
     We want to make sure
   that we connect ourselves

00:03:13.272 --> 00:03:15.807 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
     not only in our body
 and our minds, which we talk

00:03:15.807 --> 00:03:18.977 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
     we want to make sure
  that the health of our body

00:03:18.977 --> 00:03:23.415 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
  is connected to the health
 of our soil through the food

00:03:23.415 --> 00:03:28.153 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
and supplement choices we make,
   because if we can consume

00:03:28.153 --> 00:03:30.856 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
       foods, beverages,
     and even supplements

00:03:30.856 --> 00:03:33.392 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
        that are grown
     and raised properly,

00:03:33.392 --> 00:03:37.963 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
    we will be a reflection
not only of what we're eating.

00:03:37.963 --> 00:03:40.165 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
     Because the old adage
     you are what you eat,

00:03:40.165 --> 00:03:42.301 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
  but the choices we make in
           our diet

00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:47.172 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
can actually improve the soil,
  and of course, vice versa.

00:03:47.172 --> 00:03:51.877 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
 Well, and when we are talking
   about ingesting our food,

00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:55.113 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
        our nutrients,
this affects the gut microbiome.

00:03:55.113 --> 00:03:57.316 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
     So why is gut health
         so important?

00:03:57.316 --> 00:03:59.618 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
There was actually a great book
       written years ago

00:03:59.618 --> 00:04:03.121 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
       by a pathologist
   called The Second Brain.

00:04:03.121 --> 00:04:05.791 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
          And Doctor
   Gershon said in the book

00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:08.593 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
    that there's more brain
     chemicals produced in

00:04:08.593 --> 00:04:11.596 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
      your gut than there
is anywhere else in your body.

00:04:11.596 --> 00:04:16.168 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
    So it isn't just about
gut symptoms or a tummy ache or

00:04:16.168 --> 00:04:20.138 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
health conditions that we know
are causing an imbalanced gut.

00:04:20.138 --> 00:04:23.575 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
     Everything you do in
 your body is governed by your

00:04:23.575 --> 00:04:25.344 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
  gut, including metabolism,

00:04:25.344 --> 00:04:26.578 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
which we're going to talk about
            today.

00:04:26.578 --> 00:04:28.747 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
    Yes. And immune system,
       immune function,

00:04:28.747 --> 00:04:31.016 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
  most of which is connected
        to gut health.

00:04:31.016 --> 00:04:34.152 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
Of course, we are talking about
    unique supplementation

00:04:34.152 --> 00:04:37.322 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
     that is all connected
    back to Jordan's farms.

00:04:37.322 --> 00:04:41.259 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
And I was lucky enough to visit
Jordan on his farm in Tennessee

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.629 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
 and see what it really takes
      to grow superfoods.

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:45.764 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
      Let's take a look.

00:04:45.764 --> 00:04:46.898 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
       We see all these

00:04:46.898 --> 00:04:49.501 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
     beautiful plants, but
we're talking about probiotics.

00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:52.237 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
        And you believe
  some of the best probiotics

00:04:52.237 --> 00:04:54.106 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
 actually come from the soil.

00:04:54.106 --> 00:04:56.241 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
        All probiotics
   originate from the soil.

00:04:56.241 --> 00:04:57.442 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
           And years

00:04:57.442 --> 00:05:00.879 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
  ago, our ancestors consumed
  fresh food from the ground.

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:04.583 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
They would pick a carrot, wipe
 the dirt off on the surface,

00:05:04.583 --> 00:05:07.719 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
     and then consume it,
    putting in their bodies

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:12.758 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
trillions of what we call soil
based organisms, or probiotics.

00:05:12.758 --> 00:05:15.861 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
 These probiotics are integral
   to the health of plants.

00:05:15.861 --> 00:05:19.197 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
           In fact,
they guard the roots of plants,

00:05:19.197 --> 00:05:21.366 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
          making sure
 that they are protected from

00:05:21.366 --> 00:05:25.237 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
         various germs
like parasites, bacteria, fungi,

00:05:25.237 --> 00:05:29.241 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
         even viruses
 and they help absorb certain

00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:34.246 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
nutrients, primarily minerals,
into the root system of plants.

00:05:34.246 --> 00:05:38.417 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
 And lastly, they even support
    plant hormone balance,

00:05:38.417 --> 00:05:40.819 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
          essentially
     being a living shield

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.656 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
and a nutrient delivery system
  to the plants that we eat.

00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:48.427 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
  Best of all, when we ingest
   probiotics from the soil,

00:05:48.427 --> 00:05:52.063 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
like the Regenerative Organics
     Certified Probiotics

    digestion, elimination.

00:05:58.804 --> 00:06:02.274 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
     And these organisms,
 once they're in our gut, act

00:06:02.274 --> 00:06:03.809 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
      as a living shield.

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:06.478 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
        Now we know why

00:06:07.846 --> 00:06:10.582 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start

supplements are created equal.

   Jordan is going to share

00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:25.197 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start 
   In fact, they are boiled
      in order to ensure

00:06:25.197 --> 00:06:29.067 line:74.00% position:10.00% align:start

 where they're supposed to go.
